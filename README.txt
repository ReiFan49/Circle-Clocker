[ HOW TO PLAY ]
Note appears from center to the edge of the pie.
The pie is your hitzone, the note is considered as hit
only and only passes through the center of the pie.
A judgement is given if the hitzone is hovered over
before or after the note passes the edge of the pie.

Usually, EXCEL (which is the highest judgement) appears
if you hovered earlier, however if you late to hover it, 
you still have some chance and the judgement lowers 
gradually, from HIT to MISS.

There's a special judgement given if the hitzone is
hovered JUST at the note passes (it have great tolerance,
to prevent AUTOPLAY desynchronize), which gives extra
score and helps you to pass the chart easier. It is
called [ JUST ] judgement, gives 10% of the EXCEL bonus,
but it allows you to reach SS rank easier, and there's
a hidden RANK that accessible whenever all possible JUST
is captured along the play.

[ CUSTOM CHART ]
you can do it. only with .osu format.
see the example for how to do it thingy.
position mapping applied at the first set of notes.

[[ IS MY CHART INVALID ]]
autoplay will throw an error if you cannot give a
playable chart. i do console. so do you.
(i'm too lazy for now)

[[ HOW DOES AUTOPLAY CALCULATE ITS MOVE ]]
http://en.wikipedia.org/Dynamic_Programming
i use the technique that given on that page.
simple and easy.

[ CUSTOM SKIN ]

[ FEEDBACK ]

it now. already out of osu though :P
